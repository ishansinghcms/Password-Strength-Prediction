# Password Strength Prediction

This project aims to develop a predictive model to assess the strength of passwords using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It involves semantic analysis of passwords to characterize their patterns and derive features such as length, character frequencies, and presence of special characters. The model is built using classification algorithms to predict password strength accurately.

## Introduction

In today's digital world, password security is crucial for protecting sensitive information. Assessing the strength of passwords helps in identifying weak passwords that are susceptible to hacking attempts. This project addresses the need for an automated system to evaluate password strength effectively.

## Semantic Analysis

The project involves semantic analysis of passwords to extract meaningful features such as:
- Presence of numeric, uppercase, lowercase, alphabetic, alphanumeric, and special characters.
- Frequency of character types (e.g., lowercase, uppercase, digits).
- Length of passwords.

## Feature Engineering

Derived features from semantic analysis are used to enhance the model's predictive capability. Feature engineering involves:
- Preprocessing password data and extracting relevant features.
- Analyzing feature distributions and overlaps across different strength categories.
- Selecting informative features for model training.

## Model Building

Classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression are employed to build the predictive model. The model is trained on a dataset comprising password features and their corresponding strength labels. It learns to classify passwords into different strength categories based on their feature representations.

## Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using standard evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The trained model is tested on a holdout dataset to assess its ability to generalize to unseen password samples. Performance visualizations such as confusion matrices and ROC curves may be used to analyze model behavior.
